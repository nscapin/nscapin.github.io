Hello and welcome to my website!

I am Nicolò Scapin and I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) with a joint appointment between the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.princeton.edu/) and the [High Meadows Environmental Institute](https://environment.princeton.edu/). Here, I work with [Prof. Luc Deike](https://ldeike.princeton.edu/) in collaboration with [Prof. Gabe Vecchi](https://vecchi.princeton.edu/). Before I was a PhD student at the [Department of Engineering Mechanics](https://www.kth.se/en/tekmek/institutionen-for-teknisk-mekanik-1.1204789) at [Kungliga Tekniska högskolan](https://www.kth.se/) in Stockholm (Sweden).

Research
======
I am a fluid dynamicist specializing in understanding the fundamental physical processes underlying free-surface and multiphase flows, including wind wave formation and the dynamics of droplets and bubbles. These processes are critically important across very different applications, ranging from spray combustion and chemical or energy conversion systems to healthcare for modeling the spread of infectious diseases, as well as environmental phenomena like air-sea and air-land interactions.

In my research, I use computational tools and quantitative reasoning to understand the fundamental physics behind all these processes.
